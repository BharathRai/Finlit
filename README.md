*(Note: The backend might take a few seconds to spin up on the first visit if it has been idle.)*

## How It Works: Quiz to Dashboard Flow üß†‚û°Ô∏èüìä

A core feature of FinLit Hub is the personalized learning journey that starts with our assessment quiz:

1.  **Start with the Quiz:** Navigate to the **[Quiz Page](https://finlit-hub.onrender.com/quiz)**.
2.  **Assess Your Knowledge:** Answer the questions covering various financial topics. Your answers, along with your self-reported confidence level for each question, help the application build a profile of your current understanding.
3.  **Submit Answers:** Once you complete all the questions, click the "Submit & See Dashboard" button.
4.  **View Your Personalized Dashboard:** Upon successful submission, the backend processes your answers, generates your unique user profile (identifying potential knowledge gaps, misconceptions, areas needing reinforcement, and proficient topics), and **you will be automatically redirected** to your **[Dashboard Page](https://finlit-hub.onrender.com/dashboard)**.

Your personalized dashboard provides:
*   A summary of your assessment results.
*   Visualizations of your estimated knowledge and confidence across different financial categories.
*   Tailored content recommendations to help you focus your learning.
*   A place to track topics you've explicitly marked as interesting.

## Getting Started Locally üöÄ

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended) & npm (or yarn)
*   Python (v3.9 or later recommended) & pip

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BharathRai/Finlit.git
    cd Finlit
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd finlit-backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file in the finlit-backend directory
    # Add necessary environment variables, especially for local development CORS:
    # CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173

    # Run the backend server
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend should now be running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Open a **new terminal** window.
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd financial-literacy-app
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or: yarn install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `financial-literacy-app` directory.
    *   Add the backend API base URL to the `.env` file (adjust port if needed):
        ```env
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
        ```
    *   Run the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # or: yarn dev
        ```
    The frontend should now be accessible, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment üåê

This project is configured for deployment on Render:

*   The **frontend** (`financial-literacy-app`) is deployed as a **Static Site**.
    *   Build Command: `npm run build`
    *   Publish Directory: `dist`
    *   **Important:** A rewrite rule is needed for React Router:
        *   Source: `/*`
        *   Destination: `/index.html`
        *   Action: `Rewrite`
    *   Environment Variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` must be set to the live backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api`).
*   The **backend** (`finlit-backend`) is deployed as a **Web Service**.
    *   Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
    *   Environment Variable `CORS_ORIGINS` must be set to the live frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com`).
